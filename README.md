# JS Loading Bar 

**Why?**

For our final project [Challenge Me](http://challenge--me.herokuapp.com/), we wanted it include a dynamic bar that would display how much a user had raised of their fundraising target.

We decided to implement a loading bar using: 

 + JavScript
 + JQuery
 + HTML 
 + CSS 
 + Tested using Jasmine
