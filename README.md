# JS Loading Bar 

For our final project, [Challenge Me](http://challenge--me.herokuapp.com/), we wanted to include a dynamic loading bar that would display how much a user had raised of their fundraising target.

We decided to implement the loading bar using: 

 + JavScript
 + JQuery
 + HTML 
 + CSS 
 + Tested using Jasmine
